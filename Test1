Hereâ€™s an **Ansible exercise** focused on replacing a specific line in the `sshd_config` file. This exercise will introduce the team to the `lineinfile` module, which is ideal for managing individual lines in configuration files.

---

### **Exercise: Replacing a Line in `sshd_config`**
#### Objective  
Update the SSH configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to ensure a specific setting is configured. For example:  
- Replace the `PermitRootLogin` directive with `PermitRootLogin no`.  
- Ensure the file reflects this setting and restart the `sshd` service to apply changes.

---

### **Playbook File: `update_sshd_config.yml`**
```yaml
- name: Update sshd_config to disable root login
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Backup the sshd_config file
      copy:
        src: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup
        remote_src: yes

    - name: Disable root login in sshd_config
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
        line: 'PermitRootLogin no'
        state: present
        backup: yes

    - name: Restart the SSH service
      service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted
```

---

### **Explanation**  
1. **Backup Task**:  
   A backup of the original `sshd_config` file is created using the `copy` module. This ensures a safety net in case anything goes wrong.  

2. **Modify Task**:  
   The `lineinfile` module checks for the line starting with `PermitRootLogin` and ensures it is replaced with `PermitRootLogin no`.  
   - `regexp`: Matches lines starting with `PermitRootLogin`.  
   - `line`: The new line to enforce.  
   - `backup`: Creates a backup of the file before modifying it.  

3. **Restart Task**:  
   The `service` module restarts the SSH daemon to apply the updated configuration.  

---

### **Commands to Run**  
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory update_sshd_config.yml
```

---

### **Expected Outcome**  
1. The `PermitRootLogin` directive in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` is updated to `PermitRootLogin no`.  
2. SSH service is restarted successfully.  
3. If you check `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, the updated line should be present.

Would you like additional enhancements, such as making this playbook handle multiple SSH configuration settings?
